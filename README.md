## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline.
- Adhere to Security Best Practices.
- Follow DevSecOps principles.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Code Commit:** Code is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub.
2. **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins is used for automated builds triggered by code changes.
3. **Testing:** Junit is employed for unit testing to ensure code quality.
4. **Code Quality Analysis:** SonarQube scans the code for potential issues and enforces coding standards.
5. **Containerization:** Docker is utilized for containerization of the application.
6. **Container Security Scanning:** Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
7. **Artifact Storage:** AWS S3 is used to store artifacts.
8. **Container Registry:** Docker Hub is the registry for Docker images.
9. **Communication:** Slack notifications are integrated into the pipeline.
